# Welcome

Hello, I'm MothWaves --- Moth, for short --- and this is my personal website. A hub for all my activities. If you're looking to know who I am and what I do, this is the place to start.  

You can also see and go to my other main accounts by clicking the icons on the side-bar to the left.

## Who am I?

I am an independent software developer and artist with ADHD. My interests are varied but are primarily focused on Game Development. I am mostly self-taught and still learning and really not that good on the *art* aspect of "software developer and artist" but I'm hoping to improve that soon.  

As someone who likes open-source software, I also try to mostly make open-source software and contribute to the FOSS community. This website, for example, has the source code freely available to examine on github, although under a restrictive license due to the content here being personal in nature. 

This also extends to videogame development, meaning I try my best to offer native support for Linux (especially since that's where I do most of my videogame development) and try to make at least a few of my games open-source.

## Business

I am currently open for freelance work! If you have any other business proposals, feel free to send me an email and be sure to check out my [contact information](./links/). 

## Support me

If you like what I do and wish to support my work, you can find my ko-fi on the side-bar or [here](https://ko-fi.com/mothwaves). You can also check out my games on itch.io. Rating and sharing them is already a ***huge*** help. Thank you for showing interest in my work!

## Interests

Here's a list of what I'm interested in and what you can probably expect from my content. This isn't an exhaustive list and it might change over time but it is a overview of the important ones:

- Game Development

- Cyber Security (Mostly Encryption)

- Pixel Art

- Writing (Fiction)

- Web Development

- FOSS

## Contacting

See the side-bar or the [links](./links/) section for more contact details.
