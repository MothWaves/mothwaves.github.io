Aside from some game projects I have in mind my next two programming projects both revolve around time. One is a *daily tasks, habit-tracking cli/ncurses* app meant to help me organize tasks for me to do daily. The second is a timezone converter like the unix command `date`, although hopefully it'll be more robust when it comes to some of the timezones with Daylight savings time and Standard time variants (like ET, which has EST and EDT) which is where I've seen that `date` sort of tends to fall apart.

I thought since I'm going to be focusing on those two apps for the recent future, alongside some other projects, it might be a good idea to write a post about time in programming and the struggles that come with using it in a program.
