## Preamble

Most of the tools listed here are going to be open-source, since I tend to prefer open-source software for ideological and practical reasons. Although, that doesn't mean I won't use proprietary software, every now and then.

None of these tools serve as a restriction and I am willing to work with other tools if needed. This list is simply meant to provide an overview of my usual work-flow for any who are curious. 

## Operating Systems

- Arch Linux: My preferred and primary operating system.

- Windows 10: Mostly for gaming

## Programming Environment

- [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs): My main text-editor and code editor.

- Bash: My terminal.

- git: My versioning control system.

- Github: To host most of my git repositories. (Although I have been looking into Codeberg.)

- [MarkText](https://www.marktext.cc/): For writing markdown files. (Like this one!)

## Game Development

- Godot: My preferred game engine.

## Art

- Aseprite: For pixel-art.

- Blender: For 3D modeling.

- G.I.M.P: For image editing. 

## Music/SFX

- LMMS: Whenever I need to make music for my games or for some other reason.

## Misc.

Less important or less commonly used tools. 

- neovim/vim: For quick text-editing.

- VS Code: Occasionally, my code-editor. 

- [LiteXL](https://lite-xl.com/): For editing text files.

- Lutris: For game management in Linux.

- Vivaldi: Preferred web-browser. Not *fully* open-source but good enough.

- [Thorium](https://thorium.rocks/): Alternative web-browser for quick searches.

- MPD with ncmpcpp: For listening to music.

- Bryce3D: Occasionally use it for [surreal retro renders](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrKR4JkIWJT/).

### Personal Organization

- [calcurse](https://calcurse.org/): An ncurses terminal calendar application.

- org-mode: Emacs org-mode for todo lists and notes.

- taskwarrior: For simple task management. (Often ignored.)

- Thunderbird: Email Client.

### Security

- KeepassXC: Password Manager.

### Looking into

Tools that I have not yet put a lot of practice or time into but I'm interested in checking out.

- Trello/Focalboard: I have used Trello in the past and will probably in the future but I am interested in checking out Focalboard as an alternative

- Pandoc: Don't have a lot of practice with but seems pretty useful.

- Taskell: A kanban board (like Trello) task manager.
